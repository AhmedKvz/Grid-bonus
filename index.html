                current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
                I got every penny's worth.</h1>
              <p class="opacity">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found in incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched
                careers, working as a Software Engineer at VR startup."</p>

              <h1 class="h1-black">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recomended!</h1>
              <p class="h1-black">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                next level in a waythat no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                often referred to it during interviws as an example of my development
                experience. It certanly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomended! "</p>
